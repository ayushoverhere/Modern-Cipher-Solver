# Modern-Cipher-Solver
In this program, I tried to add a caesar cipher and multiplicative cipher encryption and decryption function.
I added functionality like bruteforce only for caesar cipher for now.
I tried my best efforts to handle incorrect input, and some errors, and I always wanted to have a optimised version of the program so that it will take less time and less memory, 
I believe my code is still not optimised much, so maybe I will try my best to optimise it later.
# Conclusions
I will add some more ciphers more later.
Well, the logic part is simple.
# Future Plans
I have wasted most of my time in optimising it ,making inputs error free and the program error free. 
I guess, I will break the program into different parts - like modules in future.
