# Modern-Cipher-Solver
It can solve some of the most common cypher like Caesar cipher and Multiplicative cipher with encryption and decryption function.
I added functionality like bruteforce.
I tried my best efforts to handle incorrect input, and some errors, and I always wanted to have a optimised version of the program so that it will take less time and less memory.

# Conclusions
Well, the logic part is simple.
I have wasted most of my time in optimising it ,making inputs error free and the program error free.
# Future Plan 
I will add some more ciphers later.
I guess, I will break the program into different parts - like modules in future. 
I believe my code is still not optimised much, so maybe I will try my best to optimise it later.
